I am learning python. I'm on sabbatical,  so I actually have time and the patience to learn something new. 
My work consists mostly of reading in catalogs and plotting things,  so I'm using numpy, 
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html), and 
[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/).   Sometimes I use [astropy](http://www.astropy.org/) 
for modelling,  or reading in images.   And when I'm really ambitious,
I actually to compute my own numbers,  with [astroML](http://www.astroml.org/index.html) 
or [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html).
