I am learning python. I'm on sabbatical,  so I actually have time and the patience to learn something new. 
My work consists mostly of reading in catalogs and plotting things,  so I'm using numpy, pandas, and 
matplotlib.   Sometimes I use astropy for modelling,  or reading in images.   And when I'm really ambitious,
I actually to compute my own numbers,  with astroML or scikit-learn.
