Among other things,  I'm the PI of the [Frontier Fields](https://frontierfields.org/2014/01/27/searching-for-cosmic-dawn/), 
a 800+ hour Hubble program to see distant galaxies fainter than
any ever seen before.  Did we succeed?  The answer is [definitely yes](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...835..113L). 

Also,  we got alot of really nice pictures.   IMHO, Abell 370 is the best Frontier Field.
